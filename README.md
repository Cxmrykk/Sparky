### Building
Minimum requirements are `npm` and `git` installed on the user's system
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Cxmrykk/Sparky.git
cd Sparky
npm install # install dependencies
npx rescript # compile ReScript to JS
npx react-native start # start testing environment
```

### Concepts
#### Feeds
- Add users, tags
- Whitelist/Blacklist posts with certain tags
- Each feed has its own users and tags. (Configurable by user)
